# VendingMachine

This is a .net core console application. The project separates its concerns using namespaces and not folders or pojects
because I wanted to complete it as fast as possible. Best practice would be to have projects, folders and individual .cs files for 
each class. Only one tests has also been written due to time constaints as well. I plan to expand the test coverage over time.
